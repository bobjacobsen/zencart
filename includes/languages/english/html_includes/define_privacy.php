<h2>Information Collected and How We Use It</h2>

We collect two types of information about visitors:
<ul>
<li>Personal information, which you have voluntarily submitted to us through our information request, on-line ordering or e-mail address.
<li>Aggregate information, automatically collected non-identifying statistics, (such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages accessed, etc.) Our web servers collect the IP addresses of visitors, not the e-mail addresses. Gateway 2020 uses this information to measure the use of our site, to improve the content of our site, and to monitor access for security purposes. 
</ul>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
Gateway 2020 provides links to a number of third-party external sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply Gateway 2020 endorsement of the external site company, its website, or the services it promotes or sells. When you leave the Gateway 2020 site to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from the Gateway 2020 .com (the "refer address").
Gateway 2020 is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of these third party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at these sites to determine how your information may be used.
